- <h2 align="left"><a id="factory-method">Factory Method (Creational Patterns)</h2>
  
A factory design pattern is a generative design pattern that helps to abstract how an object is created. This makes your code more flexible and extensible.

The basic idea of the factory design pattern is to delegate object creation to a factory class. This factory class determines which object is created.

<h4 align="left">The factory design pattern has two main components</h4>

- **Product:** The object to be created.
- **Factory:** The class that creates the product object.

<h5 align="left">Advantages of factory design pattern:</h5>

- Makes your code more flexible and extensible.
- It makes your code more readable and understandable by abstracting the object creation process.
- It makes the software development process more efficient.

<h5 align="left"> Disadvantages of the factory design pattern:</h5>

- It may be difficult to use in complex applications.
- It may cause you to write more code.

**Sample Scenario**

Here's a real-world example of the Factory Design Pattern in Jetpack Compose, focusing on a scenario where you want to implement different card layouts for displaying various types of content in a news application:

Scenario: You have a news app where each news item can be displayed in several formats like 'simple' (only text), 'rich' (with image), or 'interactive' (includes interactive elements like a poll).

### 1. Define an Interface for Card Factories:

```kotlin
interface NewsCardFactory {
    @Composable
    fun CreateCard(newsItem: NewsItem)
}

data class NewsItem(val title: String, val content: String, val imageUrl: String?)
```

### 2. Implement Concrete Factories for Each Card Type:

- Simple Card Factory:

```kotlin
class SimpleCardFactory : NewsCardFactory {
  @Composable
  override fun CreateCard(newsItem: NewsItem) {
    Card(
      modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxWidth()
        .padding(8.dp),
      shape = RoundedCornerShape(8.dp)
    ) {
      Column(
        modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)
      ) {
        Text(newsItem.title, style = MaterialTheme.typography.titleSmall)
        Text(newsItem.content, style = MaterialTheme.typography.bodyMedium)
      }
    }
  }
}
```


- Rich Card Factory:

```kotlin
class RichCardFactory : NewsCardFactory {
  @Composable
  override fun CreateCard(newsItem: NewsItem) {
    Card(
      modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxWidth()
        .padding(8.dp),
      shape = RoundedCornerShape(8.dp)
    ) {
      Column(modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)) {
        newsItem.imageUrl?.let { url ->
          AsyncImage(
            model = url,
            contentDescription = null,
            contentScale = ContentScale.FillBounds,
            modifier = Modifier
              .fillMaxWidth()
              .height(200.dp)
              .clip(RoundedCornerShape(3.dp))
          )
        }
        Text(newsItem.title, style = MaterialTheme.typography.titleSmall)
        Text(newsItem.content, style = MaterialTheme.typography.bodyMedium)

      }
    }
  }
}
```


### 3. Create a Factory Provider:

```kotlin
enum class CardType { SIMPLE, RICH }

@Composable
fun CardFactoryProvider(
    cardType: CardType = CardType.SIMPLE,
    content: @Composable () -> Unit
) {
    val factory = when (cardType) {
        CardType.SIMPLE -> SimpleCardFactory()
        CardType.RICH -> RichCardFactory()
    }
    CompositionLocalProvider(LocalCardFactory provides factory) {
        content()
    }
}

private val LocalCardFactory = staticCompositionLocalOf<NewsCardFactory> { 
    SimpleCardFactory() // Default
}
```

### 4. Usage in your App:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun NewsFeed(
  newsItems: List<NewsItem>,
  modifier: Modifier,
) {
  var selectedCardType by remember { mutableStateOf(CardType.SIMPLE) }

  CardFactoryProvider(cardType = selectedCardType) { // Or dynamically choose based on item type
    LazyColumn(modifier = modifier) {
      item {
        Row(modifier = Modifier.padding(8.dp)) {
          Button(onClick = { selectedCardType = CardType.SIMPLE }) {
            Text("Simple Card")
          }
          Spacer(modifier = Modifier.width(8.dp))
          Button(onClick = { selectedCardType = CardType.RICH }) {
            Text("Rich Card")
          }
        }
      }
      items(newsItems) { item ->
        val cardFactory = LocalCardFactory.current
        cardFactory.CreateCard(item)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This approach allows for a flexible and extensible design where new types of cards can be added by creating new factories without altering existing code that uses these cards. It uses the Factory Pattern to manage the creation of different UI components based on the type of news item, enhancing modularity and maintainability of the UI.

- <h2 align="left"><a id="abstract-factory">Abstract Factory (Creational Patterns)</h2>

The abstract factory design pattern uses a factory class to create objects from multiple families. This pattern abstracts the object creation process, making your code more readable and flexible.

<h4 align="left">The abstract factory design pattern has two main components</h4>

- **Abstract factory:** A class used to create objects from multiple families.
- **Concrete factory:** A class that concretises the abstract factory and is used to create objects from a specific family.

<h5 align="left">Advantages of the abstract factory design pattern</h5>

- Makes your code more flexible and extensible.
- It makes your code more readable and understandable by abstracting the object creation process.
- It makes the software development process more efficient.

<h5 align="left"> Disadvantages of the abstract factory design pattern</h5>

- It may be difficult to use in complex applications.
- It may cause you to write more code.

**Sample Scenario**

```
ThemeComponentsFactory (Abstract Factory)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LightThemeFactory
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DarkThemeFactory
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ThemeButton
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LightThemeButton
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DarkThemeButton
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ThemeCard
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LightThemeCard
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DarkThemeCard
```

### 1. Abstract Products

Define interfaces for themed components:

```kotlin
interface ThemeButton {
    @Composable
    fun Create(onClick: () -> Unit, content: @Composable () -> Unit)
}

interface ThemeCard {
    @Composable
    fun Create(content: @Composable () -> Unit)
}
```

### 2. Abstract Factory

Define the factory interface that creates themed components:

```kotlin
interface ThemeComponentsFactory {
    fun createButton(): ThemeButton
    fun createCard(): ThemeCard
}
```

### 3. Concrete Factories

Implement theme-specific factories:

```kotlin
class LightThemeFactory : ThemeComponentsFactory {
    override fun createButton(): ThemeButton = LightThemeButton()
    override fun createCard(): ThemeCard = LightThemeCard()
}

class DarkThemeFactory : ThemeComponentsFactory {
    override fun createButton(): ThemeButton = DarkThemeButton()
    override fun createCard(): ThemeCard = DarkThemeCard()
}
```

### Usage

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ThemeSwitchingApp() {
    var isDarkTheme by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
    val themeFactory: ThemeComponentsFactory = if (isDarkTheme) {
        DarkThemeFactory()
    } else {
        LightThemeFactory()
    }
    
    Column(
        modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize().padding(16.dp)
    ) {
        themeFactory.createButton().Create(
            onClick = { isDarkTheme = !isDarkTheme }
        ) {
            Text("Switch Theme")
        }
        
        themeFactory.createCard().Create {
            Text("This is a themed card")
        }
    }
}
```

- <h2 align="left"><a id="singleton">Singleton (Creational Patterns)</h2>
  The Singleton design pattern allows only one object to be created from a class. This pattern is used when a single object is needed.

<h4 align="left">The Singleton design pattern has two main components</h4>

- **Singleton class:** This class allows only one object to be created.
- **Singleton object:** The only object created from the Singleton class.

<h5 align="left">Advantages of Singleton design pattern</h5>

- Useful in situations where a single object is needed.
- Makes your code more readable and understandable.
- It makes the software development process more efficient.

<h5 align="left"> Disadvantages of the factory design pattern</h5>

- It may be difficult to use in complex applications.
- It may cause you to write more code.

**Sample Scenario**
Imagine we want to manage a global theme configuration for an app, allowing access to the theme state from multiple places without passing it explicitly.

### Singleton Implementation

```kotlin
object ThemeConfig {
    private var darkModeEnabled: Boolean = false

    fun isDarkModeEnabled(): Boolean = darkModeEnabled

    fun toggleDarkMode() {
        darkModeEnabled = !darkModeEnabled
    }
}
```

### Usage in Composable Functions

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ThemeToggleButton() {
    val isDarkMode = remember { mutableStateOf(ThemeConfig.isDarkModeEnabled()) }

    Button(onClick = {
        ThemeConfig.toggleDarkMode()
        isDarkMode.value = ThemeConfig.isDarkModeEnabled()
    }) {
        Text(if (isDarkMode.value) "Switch to Light Mode" else "Switch to Dark Mode")
    }
}

@Composable
fun AppContent() {
    val isDarkMode = ThemeConfig.isDarkModeEnabled()
    MaterialTheme(colorScheme = if (isDarkMode) darkColors() else lightColors()) {
        ThemeToggleButton()
    }
}
```

## Ways to Implement Singleton in Kotlin

### 1. **Object Declaration** (Most Common)
- Kotlin's `object` keyword inherently implements the singleton pattern.
```kotlin
object MySingleton {
    fun doSomething() {
        println("Singleton Instance")
    }
}
```

### 2. **Lazy Initialization**
- Use the `lazy` delegate to create a singleton only when accessed for the first time.
```kotlin
class MySingleton private constructor() {
    companion object {
        val instance: MySingleton by lazy { MySingleton() }
    }
}
```

### 3. **Double-Checked Locking** (Thread-Safe Singleton)
- Ensures thread safety in a multithreaded environment.
```kotlin
class MySingleton private constructor() {
    companion object {
        @Volatile
        private var instance: MySingleton? = null

        fun getInstance(): MySingleton {
            return instance ?: synchronized(this) {
                instance ?: MySingleton().also { instance = it }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Choosing the Right Approach
- **Object Declaration**: Best for simplicity and Kotlin idiomatic code.
- **Lazy Initialization**: Ideal when the instance creation is resource-intensive and you want to delay it until needed.
- **Double-Checked Locking**: Use for thread safety in Java-style singletons.

- <h2 align="left"><a id="prototype">Prototype (Creational Patterns)</h2>
  A prototype design pattern is a design pattern that uses a prototype object to create copies of objects. This can be more efficient than creating objects directly, especially if the creation of objects is complex or time-consuming.

<h4 align="left">The Prototype design pattern has three main components</h4>

- **Prototype:** The object to be copied.
- **Copier:** The class that copies the prototype object.
- **Users:** Classes that use the copied objects.

<h5 align="left">Advantages of the Prototype design pattern</h5>

- Makes the creation of objects more efficient.
- Facilitates the creation of a number of copies with the same properties of objects.
- It allows objects to be created independently of a given state.

<h5 align="left"> Disadvantages of the Prototype design pattern</h5>

- Changing the prototype object can also change all copied objects.
- When the property of the prototype object is changed, it is also necessary to change the properties of the copied objects.

**Sample Scenario**

In Kotlin, `data class` provides a built-in `copy()` method that simplifies the implementation of the Prototype Pattern. This is particularly useful when creating multiple variations of an object with similar properties.

### Prototype Implementation

```kotlin
data class Document(
    val title: String,
    val content: String,
    val author: String
)
```
```kotlin
@Composable
fun DocumentCard(document: AppDocument, modifier: Modifier = Modifier) {
  Card(
    modifier = modifier.padding(8.dp),
    shape = MaterialTheme.shapes.medium
  ) {
    Column(modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)) {
      Text(text = "Title: ${document.title}", style = MaterialTheme.typography.bodyLarge)
      Text(text = "Content: ${document.content}", style = MaterialTheme.typography.bodyMedium)
      Text(text = "Author: ${document.author}", style = MaterialTheme.typography.bodySmall)
    }
  }
}
```

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ProtoTypeView() {
  // Original prototype
  val originalDocument = AppDocument(
    title = "Prototype Pattern",
    content = "This is the original document content.",
    author = "John Doe"
  )

  // Clone the prototype and modify properties
  val clonedDocument = originalDocument.copy(
    title = "Cloned Prototype",
    content = "This is the cloned document content."
  )

  // UI Layout
  Column(
    modifier = Modifier
      .fillMaxSize()
      .padding(16.dp),
    verticalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(16.dp)
  ) {
    Text("Documents", style = MaterialTheme.typography.titleLarge)

    // Display Original Document
    DocumentCard(document = originalDocument, modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth())

    // Display Cloned Document
    DocumentCard(document = clonedDocument, modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth())
  }
}
```

- <h2 align="left"><a id="adapter">Adapter (Structural Patterns)</h2>
The Adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. This pattern is applied to reuse an existing class or interface class by adapting it to a different interface class.

The Adapter pattern makes the interfaces of two different classes or interfaces similar to each other, allowing these classes or interfaces to be used together. In this way, it is possible to use an existing class or interface class in a new system or project without having to change or rewrite it.

<h4 align="left">The adapter design pattern has two main components</h4>

- Adapted class or interface:\*\* The purpose of the adapter pattern is to adapt this class or interface to have a different interface.
- **Adaptor class:** The adapter class is the class that adapts the adapted class or interface to have a different interface.
- **Customer class:** A class that uses the interface of the adapter class.

<h5 align="left">Adapter design pattern advantages</h5>

- It allows you to use an existing class or interface in a new system or project without changing it.
- It makes it easier to bring together different technologies or platforms.
- It allows to extend the functionality of a class or interface.

<h5 align="left"> Disadvantages of the Adapter design pattern</h5>

- The adapter class must support the full functionality of the adapted class or interface.
- The adapter class may be dependent on the code of the adapted class or interface.

**Sample Scenario**

This example demonstrates the Adapter pattern in a scenario where you want to adapt one type of data model to another for display purposes within Jetpack Compose, without involving any legacy components. You're building a weather app where you fetch weather data in a particular format (`WeatherData`) from an API. However, your UI layer expects a different format (`WeatherPresentation`) for rendering. Instead of changing the data fetching logic or the UI layer, you can use an Adapter to transform `WeatherData` to `WeatherPresentation`.

### Data Models:

```kotlin
data class WeatherData(
    val temperature: Float,
    val humidity: Float,
    val windSpeed: Float,
    val condition: String
)

data class WeatherPresentation(
    val tempDisplay: String,
    val humidityDisplay: String,
    val windDisplay: String,
    val weatherIcon: Int
)
```

### Problem:
The WeatherData format needs to be converted into WeatherPresentation for display in the UI.

### Solution:
Create an Adapter to convert WeatherData to WeatherPresentation.

### Implementation

1. Create the Adapter:

```kotlin
class WeatherDataAdapter {
  fun adapt(data: WeatherData): WeatherPresentation {
    return WeatherPresentation(
      tempDisplay = "${data.temperature}¬∞C",
      humidityDisplay = "${data.humidity}%",
      windDisplay = "${data.windSpeed} m/s",
      weatherIcon = when (data.condition.lowercase()) {
        "sunny" -> R.drawable.logo
        "cloudy" -> R.drawable.ic_launcher_background
        "rainy" -> R.drawable.ic_launcher_foreground
        else -> R.drawable.logo
      }
    )
  }
}
```

This adapter class takes WeatherData and formats it into WeatherPresentation, which is more suitable for UI display. It converts temperatures, humidity, and wind speed into user-friendly strings and selects an appropriate icon based on the weather condition.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun WeatherScreen(weatherData: WeatherData) {
    val adapter = remember { WeatherDataAdapter() }
    val presentation = adapter.adapt(weatherData)

    Column(modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)) {
        Text("Temperature: ${presentation.tempDisplay}")
        Text("Humidity: ${presentation.humidityDisplay}")
        Text("Wind Speed: ${presentation.windDisplay}")
        Image(
            painter = painterResource(presentation.weatherIcon),
            contentDescription = "Weather Icon",
            modifier = Modifier.size(50.dp)
        )
    }
}
```
Here, we use the adapter to transform the incoming WeatherData into WeatherPresentation format before displaying it in our Composable UI.

- <h2 align="left"><a id="bridge">Bridge (Structural Patterns)</h2>
Bridge design pattern is a design pattern used to combine two independent hierarchical structures (abstraction and implementation) and to allow them to be modified separately. This pattern aims to create a more flexible structure by separating the abstraction of an object and the functionality (implementation) that operates on that abstraction.

<h4 align="left">Bridge design pattern has 4 main components</h4>

**Abstraction:** This is the layer where the client interacts with an interface and where functionality is not fully realised.

**Refined Abstraction:** These are subclasses of Abstraction and address a specific situation.

**Implementation:** This is the layer that actually implements the abstraction.

**Concrete Implementation:** These are subclasses of Implementation and actually implement a specific case.

<h5 align="left">Advantages of the Bridge design pattern</h5>

- Flexibility and Extensibility: The abstraction and implementation can be changed independently of each other, which facilitates changes to the system.

- Encapsulation: Application details can be hidden from the abstraction. The client interacts only with the abstraction.

- Change Management: Changes on one side do not affect the other. For example, only the abstraction can change and the application can remain unchanged, or vice versa.

<h5 id="bridge" align="left"> Disadvantages of the Bridge design pattern</h5>

- Complexity: The implementation of the pattern can sometimes lead to complexity, especially if the size of the project is small or the requirements are simple, this complexity may be unnecessary.

**Sample Scenario**

So how can we implement this in a real application, package, etc. Let's look at it. Due to our scenario, we want to use our own video processing technology instead of the video processing technology of applications such as Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. in our project. While doing this, we need to consider the potential for applications with different video processing technologies to be included in our project in the future. At this point, **Birdge Design Pattern** comes into play. Our aim is to ensure that the old code structure can be renewed and continue to function whenever it is renewed.

As per our scenario, we are writing an **abstract** class for our own **Video Processor** technology. In it we have a method signature named **process(String videoFile)**.

```kotlin
// 1. Define the VideoProcessor abstraction.
interface VideoProcessor {
    fun process(videoFile: String)
}
```

Now it is time to implement our **Video Processor** technology for the related video/videos. For this, let's assume that we support HD, UHD (4K) and QUHD (8K) video quality. For each video quality, we get **instantiation** from our **Video Processor** **abstract** class.

```kotlin
// 2. Define concrete implementations for VideoProcessor.
class HDProcessor : VideoProcessor {
    override fun process(videoFile: String) {
        println("$videoFile is being processed with HD quality.")
    }
}
```

```kotlin
class UHD4KProcessor : VideoProcessor {
    override fun process(videoFile: String) {
        println("$videoFile is being processed with UHD 4K quality.")
    }
}
```

```kotlin
class QUHD8KProcessor : VideoProcessor {
    override fun process(videoFile: String) {
        println("$videoFile is being processed with QUHD 8K quality.")
    }
}
```

Then we define an interface for **Video**. In it, we ensure that our **Video Processor** technology is implemented compulsorily. Then we define an empty method named **play(String videoFile)** for the video.

```kotlin
abstract class Video(private val processor: VideoProcessor) {
    abstract fun play(videoFile: String)

    protected fun process(videoFile: String) {
        processor.process(videoFile)
    }
}
```

```kotlin
class YoutubeVideo(processor: VideoProcessor) : Video(processor) {
    override fun play(videoFile: String) {
        process(videoFile)
        println("Playing $videoFile on YouTube.")
    }
}
```
Now let's start running our scenario for Netflix and Youtube. We create separate classes for both Netflix and Youtube and inherit from the **Video** interface.

```kotlin
class NetflixVideo(processor: VideoProcessor) : Video(processor) {
    override fun play(videoFile: String) {
        process(videoFile)
        println("Playing $videoFile on Netflix.")
    }
}
```

```kotlin
class AmazonPrimeVideo(processor: VideoProcessor) : Video(processor) {
    override fun play(videoFile: String) {
        process(videoFile)
        println("Playing $videoFile on Amazon Prime.")
    }
}
```

So how can we use this on the UI side?

```kotlin
@Composable
fun BridgeView() {
  val context = LocalContext.current

  Column(
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
    verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center,
    horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally
  ) {
    Button(
      onClick = {
        val youtubeVideo = YoutubeVideo(HDProcessor())
        youtubeVideo.play("video_hd.mp4")
        Toast.makeText(context, "Playing HD video on YouTube", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
      }) {
      Text("Watch HD Video on YouTube")
    }

    Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(16.dp))

    Button(
      onClick = {
        val netflixVideo = NetflixVideo(UHD4KProcessor())
        netflixVideo.play("video_4k.mp4")
        Toast.makeText(context, "Playing UHD 4K video on Netflix", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)
          .show()
      }) {
      Text("Watch UHD 4K Video on Netflix")
    }

    Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(16.dp))

    Button(
      onClick = {
        val amazonPrimeVideo = AmazonPrimeVideo(QUHD8KProcessor())
        amazonPrimeVideo.play("video_8k.mp4")
        Toast.makeText(context, "Playing QUHD 8K video on Amazon Prime", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)
          .show()
      }) {
      Text("Watch QUHD 8K Video on Amazon Prime")
    }
  }
}
```

- <h2 align="left"><a id="composite">Composite (Structural Patterns)</h2>
The Composite design pattern is a powerful structural pattern that allows you to treat individual objects and composites of objects in the same way. It helps you create object hierarchies that treat both parts (individual objects) and wholes (composite objects) in the same way.

<h4 align="left">There are three main components of the composite design pattern</h4>

- **Abstract Interface:** This is the foundation of the model. It defines the common behaviour that all objects in the hierarchy, both individual and composite, must follow.
- **Concrete Classes:** These are implementations of the abstract interface representing specific types of objects. Each class defines its own behaviour for the interface methods.
- **Client Code:** This is the code that interacts with objects in the hierarchy. Clients only see the abstract interface, allowing them to treat both individual objects and composites in the same way

<h5 align="left">Advantages of composite design pattern</h5>

- Clients do not need to handle different object types differently.
- More flexible and reusable code You can easily add new item types that fit the common interface.
- Easier maintenance Changes to one item type do not necessarily affect others.
- Improved code readability: The code reflects the real-world structure of your data.

<h5 align="left"> Disadvantages of the Composite design pattern</h5>

- Let's not make a big hierarchical scan, performance can be impressive.

**Sample Scenario**

For example, there are certain categories that you feel belong to the same group. For example, there are certain categories in an e-commerce application. Under these categories, there are subcategories or headings related to the relevant category. To build these structures more easily and flexibly, **Composite Design Pattern** comes into play. We can either handle related objects individually, or we can handle categories as multiple and build the hierarchy. Our goal will be to provide this flexibility.

Now the first thing we will build according to our scenario will be **Abstract Class** which will provide the common structure.

```kotlin
interface CartItem {
  fun getName(): String
  
  fun getPrice(): Double
  
  @Composable
  fun Render()
}
```

Then we create a class named **Product** for any product. We start building the structure for a single product by inheriting from the **Abstract** class named **CartItem** that we have created this class. Since it will hold information about the product, we write the necessary variables. Remember, our scenario will be an E-commerce application. Since the **buildItemWidget()** method returns generic, we prefer to write a **Card** for the product.

```kotlin
data class Product(
  val title: String,
  val description: String,
  val imageUrl: String,
  private val price: Double,
  var quantity: Int = 0
) : CartItem {
  override fun getName() = title
  override fun getPrice() = price * quantity

  @Composable
  override fun Render() {
    Card(
      modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxWidth()
        .padding(8.dp)
    ) {
      Row(
        modifier = Modifier
          .padding(8.dp)
          .fillMaxWidth(),
        verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically
      ) {
        Image(
          painter = rememberAsyncImagePainter(imageUrl),
          contentDescription = null,
          modifier = Modifier
            .size(60.dp)
            .clip(RoundedCornerShape(8.dp))
        )
        Spacer(modifier = Modifier.width(8.dp))
        Column(modifier = Modifier.weight(1f)) {
          Text(text = title, style = MaterialTheme.typography.titleMedium)
          Text(text = description, style = MaterialTheme.typography.bodyMedium)
        }
        Row {
          IconButton(onClick = { if (quantity > 0) quantity-- }) {
            Icon(imageVector = Icons.Default.Clear, contentDescription = "Remove")
          }
          Text(text = "$quantity", modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.CenterVertically))
          IconButton(onClick = { quantity++ }) {
            Icon(imageVector = Icons.Default.Add, contentDescription = "Add")
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now it is time to build a product tree collectively. In our scenario, we will consider the **Car** and **Desktop Computer** categories. Since these categories can be divided into many parts (wheels, motherboard, etc.)
We create a class named **Category** that inherits from **CartItem** **Abstract** class to manage related structures in a common way. The **buildItemWidget()** method returns the **ExpansionPanel** and we collect other similar products in the **final List<CartItem<dynamic>> children** list under a single common category heading.

```kotlin
data class Category(
  private val name: String,
  val children: List<CartItem>,
  var isExpanded: Boolean = false
) : CartItem {
  override fun getName() = name
  override fun getPrice() = children.sumOf { it.getPrice() }

  @Composable
  override fun Render() {
    var expanded by remember { mutableStateOf(isExpanded) }
    Column(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth().padding(8.dp)) {
      Row(
        modifier = Modifier
          .fillMaxWidth()
          .clickable { expanded = !expanded }
          .padding(8.dp),
        verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically
      ) {
        Text(text = name, style = MaterialTheme.typography.titleMedium)
        Spacer(modifier = Modifier.weight(1f))
        Icon(
          imageVector = if (expanded) Icons.Default.ArrowDropDown else Icons.Default.KeyboardArrowUp,
          contentDescription = null
        )
      }
      if (expanded) {
        Column {
          children.forEach { it.Render() }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Let's see what kind of usage scenario can be on the UI side. First of all, we create a list to set the relevant category and single products. As I said before, our categories will be **Desktop Computer** and **Car**. There will be related products in the sub-products.

```kotlin
val categories = listOf(
  Category(
    name = "Desktop Computer",
    children = listOf(
      Product("Main Board", "Part of the computer", "https://via.placeholder.com/150", 1000.0),
      Product("CPU", "Part of the computer", "https://via.placeholder.com/150", 2000.0)
    )
  ),
  Category(
    name = "Car",
    children = listOf(
      Product("Electric Car", "Type of the car", "https://via.placeholder.com/150", 9000.0),
      Product("Wheel", "Part of the car", "https://via.placeholder.com/150", 1000.0)
    )
  )
)

```

We display categories and single product using **ExpansionPanelList**.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ShoppingCartScreen(categories: List<Category>) {
  LazyColumn(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize().padding(8.dp)) {
    items(categories) { category ->
      category.Render()
    }
  }
}

@Preview(showBackground = true)
@Composable
fun PreviewShoppingCart() {
  MaterialTheme {
    ShoppingCartScreen(categories)
  }
}
```

- <h2 align="left"><a id="decorator">Decorator (Structural Patterns)</h2>

The Decorator design pattern is a design pattern used to dynamically add new properties to an object. This is done without changing or extending the functionality of the base object. The Decorator design pattern provides flexibility and maintainability when used correctly. However, like any design pattern, it is important to evaluate whether it suits your application requirements.

<h4 align="left">The Decorator design pattern has 3 main components</h4>

- **Abstract Component Interface(OPTIONAL):** This interface is completely optional. You can create an **abstract** behaviour for the component to be decorated.
- **Concrete Component:** This is the pure form of the component to be decorated. Optionally **abstract component interface** can be implemented.
- **Abstract Decorator Class:** Provides an **abstract** layer to decorator classes for the component to be decorated. The decor classes to be used inherit from this class.
- **Decorator Class:** Decorates the component to be decorated. More than one **decorator** class can be made for the component to be decorated.

<h5 align="left">Advantages of the Decorator design pattern</h5>

- Flexibility: The Decorator pattern provides a flexible way of dynamically adding behaviour to objects. Adding new responsibilities or removing existing ones can be done without changing classes.
- Open-Closed Principle: The Decorator pattern ensures that classes are open (allowing adding new behaviours) and closed (not modifying existing code). This helps your code to be more maintainable.
- Composite Objects: The Decorator pattern allows you to combine other objects on top of an object. This allows you to create complex structures by combining an object in different combinations.

<h5 align="left">Disadvantages of the Decorator design pattern</h5>

- Code Complexity: When the Decorator pattern is used, a number of classes are created to add additional responsibilities to an object. This can lead to code complexity over time.
- Lots of Small Objects: The Decorator pattern requires a class to be created for each decorator class. This can lead to a large number of small objects and an increase in project size.
- Logical Ordering of Wrappers: The order of the decorators is important in the Decorator pattern. In some cases, incorrect determination of the order of the decorators may lead to unexpected results.
- Complexity of Composite Objects: The complexity of composite objects can increase by adding multiple decorators. This can lead to a structure that is difficult to understand and maintain.

**Example Scenario**
We want to create a `Card` composable that can be dynamically enhanced with additional features like shadows, borders, or padding. This ensures flexibility and reusability without modifying the core implementation of the `Card`.

### Step 1: Base Composable
This is the base composable that will be decorated.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun BaseCard(content: @Composable () -> Unit) {
  Card(
    modifier = Modifier.padding(8.dp),
    elevation = CardDefaults.cardElevation(2.dp)
  ) {
    content()
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Decorator Composables

**Add Border Decorator:**
Wrap the `BaseCard` with a border.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun BorderDecorator(content: @Composable () -> Unit) {
    Box(
        modifier = Modifier.border(2.dp, Color.Blue)
    ) {
        content()
    }
}
```

**Add Shadow Decorator:**
Add shadow to the `BaseCard`.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ShadowDecorator(content: @Composable () -> Unit) {
    Box(
        modifier = Modifier.shadow(8.dp, shape = RoundedCornerShape(8.dp))
    ) {
        content()
    }
}
```

**Add Padding Decorator:**
Add extra padding around the `BaseCard`.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun PaddingDecorator(content: @Composable () -> Unit) {
    Box(
        modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)
    ) {
        content()
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Combine Decorators
You can dynamically combine these decorators as needed.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun DecoratedCard() {
  ShadowDecorator {
    BorderDecorator {
      PaddingDecorator {
        BaseCard {
          Text(
            text = "This is a decorated card!",
            modifier = Modifier.padding(8.dp)
          )
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage in a Jetpack Compose Screen

```kotlin
@Composable
fun DecoratorPatternExample() {
    Scaffold(
        topBar = {
            TopAppBar(title = { Text("Decorator Pattern Example") })
        }
    ) {
        Column(
            modifier = Modifier
                .fillMaxSize()
                .padding(16.dp),
            verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center,
            horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally
        ) {
            DecoratedCard()
        }
    }
}
```

- <h2 align="left"><a id="facade">Facade (Structural Patterns)</h2>
The Facade design pattern is a structural design pattern used to manage complex systems with a simple interface. This pattern is used to facilitate the use of systems and hide their complexity. The Facade design pattern facilitates the understandability and use of code, especially in large software systems, by limiting direct access to subsystems and combining a set of subsystem functions into a single, high-level interface.

Facade enables complex subsystems to be exposed to the outside world through a simplified interface. Users can use these systems without having in-depth knowledge about the complex structures and functioning of the subsystems.

<h4 align="left">The Facade design pattern has two main components</h4>

- **Facade:** Provides the simplified interface presented to the outside world. It combines the functions of subsystems and presents them to the user.
- **Subsystems:** Classes that contain the complex functionality covered by the Facade interface. These are not called directly by the user, but are managed by the Facade class.

<h5 align="left">Advantages of the Facade design pattern</h5>

- Enables the use of complex systems with a simpler interface.
- Reduces direct interaction with subsystems, making code easier to maintain and update.
- Facilitates testing of subsystems individually.

<h5 align="left"> Disadvantages of the Facade design pattern</h5>

- An extra layer of abstraction can sometimes lead to performance loss.
- A very simplified interface can in some cases restrict access to all features of subsystems.

**Sample Scenario**
Imagine a music player app. The app has different subsystems like audio playback, notifications, and analytics. Instead of interacting directly with these subsystems, the client (UI) interacts with a `MusicPlayerFacade` that simplifies the process.

### Step 1: Create Subsystems

#### Audio Player Subsystem
```kotlin
class AudioPlayer {
    fun play(track: String) {
        println("Playing track: $track")
    }

    fun pause() {
        println("Audio paused")
    }

    fun stop() {
        println("Audio stopped")
    }
}
```

#### Notification Subsystem
```kotlin
class NotificationManager {
    fun showNotification(track: String) {
        println("Showing notification: Now playing $track")
    }

    fun clearNotification() {
        println("Clearing notification")
    }
}
```

#### Analytics Subsystem
```kotlin
class AnalyticsManager {
    fun logEvent(event: String) {
        println("Logging event: $event")
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Facade
The `MusicPlayerFacade` simplifies interactions with these subsystems.

```kotlin
class MusicPlayerFacade(
  private val audioPlayer: AudioPlayer,
  private val notificationManager: NotificationManager,
  private val analyticsManager: AnalyticsManager
) {

  fun playTrack(track: String) {
    audioPlayer.play(track)
    notificationManager.showNotification(track)
    analyticsManager.logEvent("Track played: $track")
  }

  fun pauseTrack() {
    audioPlayer.pause()
    analyticsManager.logEvent("Track paused")
  }

  fun stopTrack() {
    audioPlayer.stop()
    notificationManager.clearNotification()
    analyticsManager.logEvent("Track stopped")
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Using the Facade in Jetpack Compose
The UI layer interacts only with the `MusicPlayerFacade`.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun FacadeView() {
  val musicPlayerFacade = remember {
    MusicPlayerFacade(
      audioPlayer = AudioPlayer(),
      notificationManager = NotificationManager(),
      analyticsManager = AnalyticsManager()
    )

  }

  var isPlaying by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
  val track = "My Favorite Song"

  Scaffold {

    Column(modifier = Modifier
      .padding(16.dp)
      .padding(it)) {
      Text("Music Player", style = MaterialTheme.typography.titleMedium)
      Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(16.dp))

      Button(
        onClick = {
          if (isPlaying) {
            musicPlayerFacade.pauseTrack()
          } else {
            musicPlayerFacade.playTrack(track)
          }
          isPlaying = !isPlaying
        }) {
        Text(if (isPlaying) "Pause" else "Play")
      }

      Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(8.dp))

      Button(
        onClick = {
          musicPlayerFacade.stopTrack()
          isPlaying = false
        }) {
        Text("Stop")
      }
    }
  }
}
```
